A large number of businesses \u0026 enterprises, ranging from large corporations to start-ups, are increasing their spending on mobile app development to create an awesome customer experience \u0026 an emotional attachment with their end users. The increasing popularity of the mobile applications has surfaced a few very imminent issues, mostly related to determining the quality of these mobile applications.\n\nMobile applications typically work with limited resources; hence the resource usage needs to be monitored continuously to avoid performance issues. More conventional functional testing approaches, like user interface testing, usability testing \u0026 integration testing with underlying application programming interface, need to be employed in addition to compatibility testing and performance testing for exhaustively testing a mobile application across multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Windows). On top of that, confidential data like phone contacts, banking and other personal information, global GPS position could be disclosed by vulnerable applications \u0026 unreliable mobile networks, so sensitive applications require validating exchanged data to avoid security issues over various available mobile networks. Other factors we need to consider while testing would be user experience, testing the interruptions caused by incoming calls or text messages while the application under test is on foreground and battery. \n\n\nThis presentation outlines the mobile test automation challenges from the perspectives of user interface design, product function, performance \u0026 security. Furthermore, we also focus on some of the gaps that exist in present day mobile app automation testing \u0026 propose some future work to enhance the existing testing frameworks.","RecommendedAudience":"This presentation will be targeted at anyone who is an user of any mobile application.","PresenterName":"Subrata Bhattacharjee","PresenterEmail":null,"PresenterTwitterAlias":"","PresenterWebsite":"","PresenterBio":"Subrata is an Engineering Team Leader, presently working with Bankwest,  with broad experience in leading cross-functional Agile engineering teams.

REST, as specified in Roy Fieldingâ€™s seminal dissertation, has become the architectural pattern of choice for APIs and when applied correctly allows for clients and servers to evolve in a loosely coupled manner. There are areas however where REST can deliver less than ideal client experiences. Often many HTTP requests are required to render a single view.\n\nWhile this may be a minor concern for a web app running on a WAN with low latency and high bandwidth, it can yield poor client experiences for mobile clients in particular. GraphQL is Facebookâ€™s response to this challenge and it is quickly proving itself as an exciting alternative to RESTful APIs for a wide range of contexts. GraphQL is a query language that provides a clean and simple syntax for consumers to interrogate your APIs. These queries are strongly typed, hierarchical and enable clients to retrieve only the data they need.\n\nIn this session, we will take a hands-on look at GraphQL and see how it can be used to build APIs that are a joy to use.","RecommendedAudience":"This talk will be pitched at an introductory level.

Next weâ€™ll look at Gradient Descent, a simple, yet powerful technique we can use to find the â€˜best fittingâ€™ parameter values for our model. Next, a weâ€™ll take a quick look at Logistic Regression and discuss the central tenant of any Neural Network, the Perceptron. With this understanding, we can jump into building and initializing a small Neural Network. The last piece of the puzzle is  how we train a Neural Network. Weâ€™ll discuss Back Propagation, an algorithm that retrospectively updates the weightings between nodes our Neural Network. With that knowledge in hand, weâ€™ll have everything required to throw some unseen data at our  Neural Network and watch the magic unfold.  Last but not least, is a look at how Neural Networks can be used in practice. Whilst the solve many real life problems, from enabling an autonomous vehicle to navigate a busy highway to detecting fraudulent banking patterns, for the purposes of this talk Iâ€™ll be demonstrating how a neural network can be used to solve the age old problem of handwriting recognition.\n\nBy attending this talk attendees will walk away with a clear understanding of the deceptively simple techniques used to build the majority of the learning algorithms used in industry (Linear Regression, Gradient Descent).
