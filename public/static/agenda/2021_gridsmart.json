We are in the midst of unprecedented technological change and yet keeping abreast of such advances alone will not guarantee success. Faced with such myriad options how can we be sure that we are guiding our organisation on the path towards future success?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will take an in-depth look at what it takes to create an adaptive technology strategy including metrics, team topologies and evolutionary architecture practices.  We'll explore how to build feedback loops into your organisation’s technology decisions and ensure that its architecture is an accelerator rather than an inhibitor of business agility:\r\n\r\n* How to identify and measure key business-aligned metrics and use these data points to pivot your technology strategy.\r\n* How to enable effective distributed technology decisions across your organisation\r\n* How to build organisational memory surrounding technology decisions that can act as inputs into new decisions.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the session, you will not only understand what is involved in creating a data-informed technology strategy but also have the knowledge to put it into practice. If you want to take to your expertise in crafting effective technology strategies to the next level, then this is the session for you. See you there!",

We've learned to move fast and break things, but this method of production often has unintended consequences; machines causing algorithmic harm towards already marginalised groups, a digital economy built to extract data and incrementally influence human behaviour with dubious consent, cryptocurrency contributing harmful emissions and cooking the planet at the same rate as a small country.\r\n\r\nWorking in the tech industry is a privilege and I want to use that good fortune to contribute to a future that is designed to enhance the wellbeing of as many people as possible - not extract and exploit. The sophistication of Indigenous thinking can not only help us build more robust ethical frameworks, but also help unlock the next frontier of technological development.\r\n\r\nIn Australia, we have the privilege of living amongst the world's oldest continuing culture. A culture that has transferred information between generations for 10s of 1000s of years with incredible fidelity does not happen by accident; it involves knowledge of living harmoniously with complex adaptive systems that Western science is slowly catching up to. \r\n\r\nWhat kind of protocols can we learn from Indigenous ways of thinking that can help us build better ethical practices for building technology? How can we optimise for wellbeing and abundance, rather than the kind of limitless growth that is at odds with a healthy planet? \r\n",

            "description": "And to be clear this is not a cluster of web servers.  This talk is about a single web server servicing 6 million requests per second.\r\n\r\nI'm the author of a web server that is ranked in the top 20 of the TechEmpower benchmarks.  These benchmarks performance test various web servers built in any technology.  All the web servers are pitted against each other and the results published yearly.  While some might question the value of performance testing, Microsoft supports these benchmarks after having been called out to improve their IIS performance.\r\n\r\nThis talk goes into the engineering of how to service 6 million requests per second.  This is definitely a technical presentation, as we deep dive into performant software on multi-core hardware. If you want warm and fuzzy soft skills, I highly recommend going elsewhere.  This is a hard skill technical presentation that will enable even junior developers to obtain an appreciation for the engineering required for high performance applications.\r\n\r\nWhat you get out of this talk is an appreciation for what high performant software looks like.  It will highlight key bottlenecks you can avoid in your everyday software practices to improve the performance of the systems you build.  It will also debunk much of the thinking about how to write performant software.  I hear so many developers concerned about certain performance aspects of software, missing simple key things that are significantly more important.",

Continuous delivery techniques such as trunk-based development have demanded the use of patterns that reduce batch size and deployment risk.\r\n\r\nFeature Toggles have emerged as a powerful pattern for enabling developers to deploy to production on-demand with confidence. Most developers will use the Feature Toggle pattern in some form through their journey - sometimes without being aware of it.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I propose the question; what exactly is a Feature Toggle? What happens if we apply the definition to all code? Could the definition of a feature toggle be broader than most expect?",

It's so useful that many people advocate for test-driven development (TDD) where you write the tests before writing any code. So why would I suggest not writing tests at all?\r\n\r\nThe tests we write now aren't good enough -- we miss things or make mistakes, so for the same reason we've automated so many other processes, it's better to let a computer do it. In this talk we will go over some ways to use formal methods like finite state machines that allow tests to be generated, rather than hand-written and how that will save you time and result in better tests and more confidence in your releases.",

It lurks inside quotation marks in source code, opaque to most to IDE tools, waiting for the unwary developer to rename or refactor something in their codebase. Everything builds and the app is deployed, only to throw runtime errors about references to non-existing HTTP endpoints, CSS classes, database tables, or asset files.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll look at the dangers of stringly-typed code. We'll see how it saps confidence in code changes, making codebases brittle. We'll look for solutions to these issues, using TypeScript to turn opaque strings into well-checked values that can be refactored with confidence.",

Turning these events into useful read models requires lots of processing, but what if we can’t afford to wait a day?\r\n\r\nLet’s go on a journey into building high performance read models from the simple to the downright silly. Let’s see how fast we can process 1 billion events.",

Designers, Product Owners, and Develpoers are often asked how to make products \"loveable\" or create new innovative solutions that \"delight\" customers. Trouble is, at the start of a project most builders don't know anything about the customers who they are building the project for.\r\n\r\nThis talk focuses on how to embrace your own lack of end-user industry expertise, adopt an experiment driven to identify the most important customer benefit of any solution and pivot from an assumption to a data driven product definition. This talk will take you through the process that is used by product teams at Amazon and other global enterprise companies to work backwards from the needs of the customer while reinforcing the value of user feedback to stakeholders.",

            "description": "We all use colours. Maybe you are a seasoned front end developer or designer, your custom terminal colour scheme is something to behold, or perhaps your small child (or you) is currently going through a finger painting stage. Regardless of what part of tech you work in, you have encountered a situation when you've had to select some colours. The question is, when you pick a colour on a colour wheel or type in a hex or RGB code, how does that colour actually appear on the screen?\r\n\r\nCome and learn about the Computer Science of colour with me. In this talk, we're going to dig deeper into hex codes. What do they mean, how and why do they get converted to RGB codes, and how does a computer use that to generate a colour we can see? We'll unpack it all by learning binary, enjoying a #throwback to mixing paint in kindergarten, and taking a much closer look at the human eye.\r\n\r\nYou will leave this talk with a whole new appreciation and understanding for the science behind something as simple as colour, something you have likely never thought twice about. This talk is not just for designers and front end developers, there is something interesting for everyone to learn here.",

The network is saturated! These are but a few of the scalability problems we encountered.\r\n\r\nTime again, how could we have avoided the pain? Can we embed performance-centric practices in our daily routines?\r\n\r\nPerformance is often a misinterpreted and unloved responsibility of the modern software engineer. Terms like “premature optimisation” can discourage us to consider the performance implications of the software we write. Additionally, many higher-level abstractions and tools we use have a less visible performance cost. I won’t mention time pressure nor agile!\r\n\r\nIn this session, we review performance principles and practices, and how they relate to common (and very real and experienced!) performance issues. I wrap it up by suggesting some simple means to embed performance practices in the daily routine. \r\n\r\nThe hope is to be blissfully unaware that a performance issue has been avoided through good practices!\r\n\r\n",

There is potentially an enormous volume of information to consider, news articles, announcements, economic indicators, world events and even the time of day. How can anyone distil all of that into a successful trade? What if there was a way to “consider” data and determine if it was tradeable, that is, can be used to make profitable share trades? Enter machine learning!\r\n \r\nIn this talk, we will explore how to use machine learning models to decide what shares to trade and when while wading through a daunting array of disparate data types. With this base level of shared understanding established, we will explore techniques of how to run machine learning at scale as well as practical techniques to automate the creation, development, scoring and deployment of machine learning models.

You can turn your lights on or watch what is happening in private homes from across the globe right from your phone. Elevators make supposedly smart decisions about how best to deliver people to their floors and smart sensors tell us what speed the traffic should flow.\r\n\r\nWe all work on, in, or around technology every day of our lives. Despite our best intentions, we sometimes build systems with the potential for great harm. Visual recognition systems have mistaken a man for a monkey, a chemical plant that nearly levelled a community or a safety system that led to stalking.\r\n\r\nHow is it, the tiny little decisions we make every day can lead to some rather unpleasant outcomes? This talk will explore how our systems are designed, built, maintained, and decommissioned and what can go wrong when we don’t consider where our decisions may lead. It poses some simple questions we can begin to ask ourselves, the companies we work for, and those we buy products from, in order to help us build a safer, fairer, and more equitable world; a world we all want to live in.

              "description": "The role of a technology leader has never been more challenging. We are in the midst of unprecedented technological change and yet keeping abreast of such advances alone will not guarantee success. Faced with such myriad options how can we be sure that we are guiding our organisation on the path towards future success?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will take an in-depth look at what it takes to create an adaptive technology strategy including metrics, team topologies and evolutionary architecture practices.  We'll explore how to build feedback loops into your organisation’s technology decisions and ensure that its architecture is an accelerator rather than an inhibitor of business agility:\r\n\r\n* How to identify and measure key business-aligned metrics and use these data points to pivot your technology strategy.\r\n* How to enable effective distributed technology decisions across your organisation\r\n* How to build organisational memory surrounding technology decisions that can act as inputs into new decisions.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the session, you will not only understand what is involved in creating a data-informed technology strategy but also have the knowledge to put it into practice. If you want to take to your expertise in crafting effective technology strategies to the next level, then this is the session for you. See you there!",

Maybe you are a seasoned front end developer or designer, your custom terminal colour scheme is something to behold, or perhaps your small child (or you) is currently going through a finger painting stage. Regardless of what part of tech you work in, you have encountered a situation when you've had to select some colours. The question is, when you pick a colour on a colour wheel or type in a hex or RGB code, how does that colour actually appear on the screen?\r\n\r\nCome and learn about the Computer Science of colour with me. In this talk, we're going to dig deeper into hex codes. What do they mean, how and why do they get converted to RGB codes, and how does a computer use that to generate a colour we can see? We'll unpack it all by learning binary, enjoying a #throwback to mixing paint in kindergarten, and taking a much closer look at the human eye.\r\n\r\nYou will leave this talk with a whole new appreciation and understanding for the science behind something as simple as colour, something you have likely never thought twice about. This talk is not just for designers and front end developers, there is something interesting for everyone to learn here.",

              "description": "Technology moves rapidly. We've learned to move fast and break things, but this method of production often has unintended consequences; machines causing algorithmic harm towards already marginalised groups, a digital economy built to extract data and incrementally influence human behaviour with dubious consent, cryptocurrency contributing harmful emissions and cooking the planet at the same rate as a small country.\r\n\r\nWorking in the tech industry is a privilege and I want to use that good fortune to contribute to a future that is designed to enhance the wellbeing of as many people as possible - not extract and exploit. The sophistication of Indigenous thinking can not only help us build more robust ethical frameworks, but also help unlock the next frontier of technological development.\r\n\r\nIn Australia, we have the privilege of living amongst the world's oldest continuing culture. A culture that has transferred information between generations for 10s of 1000s of years with incredible fidelity does not happen by accident; it involves knowledge of living harmoniously with complex adaptive systems that Western science is slowly catching up to. \r\n\r\nWhat kind of protocols can we learn from Indigenous ways of thinking that can help us build better ethical practices for building technology? How can we optimise for wellbeing and abundance, rather than the kind of limitless growth that is at odds with a healthy planet? \r\n",

Terms like “premature optimisation” can discourage us to consider the performance implications of the software we write. Additionally, many higher-level abstractions and tools we use have a less visible performance cost. I won’t mention time pressure nor agile!\r\n\r\nIn this session, we review performance principles and practices, and how they relate to common (and very real and experienced!) performance issues. I wrap it up by suggesting some simple means to embed performance practices in the daily routine. \r\n\r\nThe hope is to be blissfully unaware that a performance issue has been avoided through good practices!\r\n\r\n",

              "description": "And to be clear this is not a cluster of web servers.  This talk is about a single web server servicing 6 million requests per second.\r\n\r\nI'm the author of a web server that is ranked in the top 20 of the TechEmpower benchmarks.  These benchmarks performance test various web servers built in any technology.  All the web servers are pitted against each other and the results published yearly.  While some might question the value of performance testing, Microsoft supports these benchmarks after having been called out to improve their IIS performance.\r\n\r\nThis talk goes into the engineering of how to service 6 million requests per second.  This is definitely a technical presentation, as we deep dive into performant software on multi-core hardware. If you want warm and fuzzy soft skills, I highly recommend going elsewhere.  This is a hard skill technical presentation that will enable even junior developers to obtain an appreciation for the engineering required for high performance applications.\r\n\r\nWhat you get out of this talk is an appreciation for what high performant software looks like.  It will highlight key bottlenecks you can avoid in your everyday software practices to improve the performance of the systems you build.  It will also debunk much of the thinking about how to write performant software.  I hear so many developers concerned about certain performance aspects of software, missing simple key things that are significantly more important.",

              "description": "Trading shares is a complex proposition. There is potentially an enormous volume of information to consider, news articles, announcements, economic indicators, world events and even the time of day. How can anyone distil all of that into a successful trade? What if there was a way to “consider” data and determine if it was tradeable, that is, can be used to make profitable share trades? Enter machine learning!\r\n \r\nIn this talk, we will explore how to use machine learning models to decide what shares to trade and when while wading through a daunting array of disparate data types. With this base level of shared understanding established, we will explore techniques of how to run machine learning at scale as well as practical techniques to automate the creation, development, scoring and deployment of machine learning models. Hope to see you there!",

Most developers will use the Feature Toggle pattern in some form through their journey - sometimes without being aware of it.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I propose the question; what exactly is a Feature Toggle? What happens if we apply the definition to all code? Could the definition of a feature toggle be broader than most expect?",

It's so useful that many people advocate for test-driven development (TDD) where you write the tests before writing any code. So why would I suggest not writing tests at all?\r\n\r\nThe tests we write now aren't good enough -- we miss things or make mistakes, so for the same reason we've automated so many other processes, it's better to let a computer do it. In this talk we will go over some ways to use formal methods like finite state machines that allow tests to be generated, rather than hand-written and how that will save you time and result in better tests and more confidence in your releases.",

              "description": "Businesses often want to enlist talent that will come to them with \"genius\" ideas on how to improve their business or generate more revenue for them. Designers, Product Owners, and Develpoers are often asked how to make products \"loveable\" or create new innovative solutions that \"delight\" customers. Trouble is, at the start of a project most builders don't know anything about the customers who they are building the project for.\r\n\r\nThis talk focuses on how to embrace your own lack of end-user industry expertise, adopt an experiment driven to identify the most important customer benefit of any solution and pivot from an assumption to a data driven product definition. This talk will take you through the process that is used by product teams at Amazon and other global enterprise companies to work backwards from the needs of the customer while reinforcing the value of user feedback to stakeholders.",

              "description": "From chatbots to electric cars our world is becoming increasingly connected. You can turn your lights on or watch what is happening in private homes from across the globe right from your phone. Elevators make supposedly smart decisions about how best to deliver people to their floors and smart sensors tell us what speed the traffic should flow.\r\n\r\nWe all work on, in, or around technology every day of our lives. Despite our best intentions, we sometimes build systems with the potential for great harm. Visual recognition systems have mistaken a man for a monkey, a chemical plant that nearly levelled a community or a safety system that led to stalking.\r\n\r\nHow is it, the tiny little decisions we make every day can lead to some rather unpleasant outcomes? This talk will explore how our systems are designed, built, maintained, and decommissioned and what can go wrong when we don’t consider where our decisions may lead. It poses some simple questions we can begin to ask ourselves, the companies we work for, and those we buy products from, in order to help us build a safer, fairer, and more equitable world; a world we all want to live in.
