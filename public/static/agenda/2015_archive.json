Good for you. Each piece is now easy to understand and maintain. Except things didn\u0027t get simpler. You\u0027ve got lots of dependencies between your services to implement your business processes. You\u0027re having to modify many services to change your processes and the complexity is exploding. This isn\u0027t any better, if you can\u0027t improve things you\u0027re going back to the old way of doing things.\n\nThis talk discusses how you can use just three simple architectural patterns to design and implement microservice systems that can isolate the complexity of changes and support managing the evolution of business logic and processes over time. As a bonus it includes other buzzwords like event sourcing and CQRS at no extra charge. Process managers also deal with the distributed non-transactional nature of the system.","RecommendedAudience":"Some basic knowledge of DDD and CQRS would be helpful.","PresenterName":"Colin Scott and Zulhafiz Akbar","PresenterEmail":null,"PresenterTwitterAlias":"AbstractCode","PresenterWebsite":"","PresenterBio":"Colin Scott is an alleged carbon-based biped who has been doing .NET since 2003.

West.\n\nDo you want to write less tests for the same amount of confidence?\n\nDo you want to print out the testing pyramid on a dot matrix printer, take it outside and set fire to it?\n\nHow confident are you that you can survive the refactoring apocalypse without breaking your tests?\n\nAs consultants, my colleagues and I get to see how testing is performed across many different organisations and have a chance to experiment with different testing strategies across multiple projects. Through this experience, we have developed a pragmatic process for setting an initial testing strategy that is as simple as possible and iterating on that strategy over time to evolve it based on how it performs. We have also settled on a style of testing that has proved to be very effective at reducing testing effort while maintaining (or even improving) confidence from our tests.\n\nThis talk will focus on some of our learnings and we will cover the different types of testing and how they interact, breaking apart the usual practice of testing all applications in the same way, the mysterious relationship between speed and confidence, how we were able to throw away the testing pyramid (and watch it burnnnnn!!!) and a number of techniques that have worked well for us when testing our applications.","RecommendedAudience":"None","PresenterName":"Rob Moore and Matt Davies","PresenterEmail":null,"PresenterTwitterAlias":"robdmoore","PresenterWebsite":"http://robdmoore.id.au","PresenterBio":"Robert is a Principal Consultant with Readify and specialises in leading and mentoring software teams to deliver business value.
