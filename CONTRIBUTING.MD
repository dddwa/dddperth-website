# Contributing Guidelines

We love your input! DDD Perth is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of but not limited to: gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of others in any form. By participating in this project, you agree to the DDD Perth [code of conduct](https://dddperth.com/code-of-conduct).

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  Ensure the test suite passes.
4.  Format your code by running `yarn run format-code`
5.  Make sure your code lints by running `yarn run lint`.
6.  Go on and issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the DDD Perth License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [DDD Perth License](LICENSE.md) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/dddwa/dddperth-website/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/dddwa/dddperth-website/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail and background, and if possible sample code

When raising a bug report please include as much detail as possible to ensure we can resolve the issue with minimal friction.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

* A quick summary and/or background
* Steps to reproduce
  * Please be as specific as possible. We **really** appreciate thorough bug reports!
  * Give sample code if you can.
* What you expected would happen
* What actually happens
* Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or things you tried that didn't work)

Thank you in advance for helping us deliver an even better conference experience for all our awesome DDD attendees. We **love** your work!
