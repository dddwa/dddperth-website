        <h1>About DDD Perth</h1>
        <p>
            DDD Perth is an inclusive non-profit event for the Perth software community. Our goal is to create an
            approachable conference that anyone can attend or speak at, especially people that don't normally get to
            attend / speak at conferences. We do this by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Making the ticket price as low as possible ($50)</li>
            <li>Running the event on a Saturday</li>
            <li>Allowing anyone to submit about any software industry related topic</li>
            <li>Having a democratically chosen agenda</li>
            <li>Focussing on creating a safe and inclusive environment where everyone is welcome</li>
        </ul>
