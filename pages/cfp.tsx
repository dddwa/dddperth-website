                <p>
                    This year we are using Sessionize to track submissions - this provides a great experience for
                    speakers since you can resubmit talks submitted to other conferences that use Sessionize (e.g. NDC
                    Sydney and the other DDD conferences in Australia) and you can update your profile and session
                    information at any time.
                </p>

                <p className="text-center">

                    We want to encourage people that wouldn't normally speak at conferences to give it a go! We do this
                    by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Having <strong>anonymous session voting</strong>; we will only show the title and abstract of a
                        talk to voters to remove unconscious bias
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Having a <strong>long (45 mins) and short (20 mins)</strong> talk option
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Accepting a <strong>broad range of technical and non-technical topics</strong> related to the
                        software industry; if voters think you're talk is relevant, it's in!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Encouraging submissions from <strong>multiple presenters as well as solo presenters</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Providing a{' '}
                        <strong>
                            <a href={'mailto:' + Conference.MentoringEmail}>free mentoring service</a>
                        </strong>; we have a bunch of experienced speakers who are happy to have a confidential chat
                        with you to run through any ideas you have or give safe and constructive feedback
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    </a>
                </p>

                <p>Other things to note for presenters:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You will likely be speaking to an audience of between 50-100 people</li>
                    <li>
                        In the past we've had a huge range of presentations including the following topics:{' '}
                        {Conference.PreviouslySubmittedTopics}.
                    </li>
                    <li>You will likely be speaking to an audience of between 50-100 people.</li>
                    <li>
                        Presentations are not a sales presentation although you are welcome to have a slide or two about
                        yourself and your company.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You will probably have internet access, but you should have a backup plan in case it's
                        unavailable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We will open voting at{' '}
                        {Conference.VotingOpenFrom.format(dates.DateDisplayFormat + ' ' + dates.TimeDisplayFormat)}; if
                        your presentation gets voted in and you agree to present then this is a serious commitment
