You can use it to find gaps in your backlog, organise your backlog in a clearer way, onboard new developers, and highlight the features and stories of an MVP or upcoming release. They can even be used in a funding request or proposal to communicate your product vision.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I want to share with you how to create a simple product feature tree and why it should be used in every delivery project.",

It will also explore how we can test our assumptions by injecting failure into our applications and uncovering our weaknesses. You will leave with an understanding of how to build more resilient applications and several patterns that you can apply to your software development projects.',

Over 80 years later, it is either one impressive cat or it is surely dead. I will resurrect Schrodinger's cat and discuss the implications of and on the famous thought experiment from the perspective of the recently developed fields of quantum information and computation, but not before showing you how we can share such seemingly complex concepts even to children!",

              "Can images created with code, be art? Being creative isn’t the same as being artistic. Developers demonstrate creativity every day through problem-solving, application/system design, and code optimization. Even the most creative people can struggle to replicate the images in their heads on paper or canvas with pen or paint. \r\n\r\nSo, what can a developer do to express their inner Van Gogh, Picasso or Da Vinci? Enter creative coding; the creation of visual masterpieces with code! Imagine the graphics library as a canvas, language as paint, algorithms as the method. Let me rouse the artist within you, and inspire you to create intriguing, unique, original, and even beautiful pieces of digital art using code. \r\n\r\nJust like with traditional art, it can be hard to know how or where to start. Graphics programming often involves mathematics that can be daunting for anyone without a PhD in maths. \r\n\r\nIn this session, you will learn some ways to get started, some approaches to creating static and animated art with code, and that the maths really isn't that scary at all. You will be creating your own codified artworks in no time!",

(wrong…)\r\n\r\nIn this talk, join me on my journey of changing careers and navigating through a new industry while feeling like an imposter. Find out why you can’t (and shouldn’t have to) ban out imposter feelings on your own, and get the tools and insights you need to turn an imposter life into imposter moments.',

That used to be how I felt but not anymore!\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will guide you through the mindset required to start making the right changes on the journey to release more quickly (but still safely): the so-called "DevOps Mindset". I will share the key insights that I have learned from over 10+ years of experience in Banking, Government and the Startup space, leading teams to build, deploy and run systems comprising dozens of microservices. We\'ll explore practical techniques that you can start using today to enable your releases to go smoothly, whilst also providing you with some key areas of focus in your longer-term DevOps strategy.\r\n\r\nFinally, I\'ll introduce several really simple, practical coding techniques that make deploying at speed, easy and relatively painless...

Technical debt makes code hard to modify. Being hard to modify slows down to development.\r\n\r\nSo, how do we deal with this? We refactor!\r\n\r\nBut, refactoring is an inherently risky process. It's very easy to break things in any complex system, especially if the test coverage is less than ideal. Worse, it's possible to ruin users' experience by accidentally fixing bugs that their workflows had come to rely on. To combat this we need to ensure that our refactor doesn't change the existing behaviour in any way, while also leaving us free to add new functionality.\r\n\r\nWe're going to have a look at how to decide when we actually should refactor, and how we can use tests to ensure we maintain the existing behaviour. We'll have a look at our options for testing JSX, and the pros and cons of snapshot tests. And we'll finish up with a demo, putting it all together.",

What about using the chart without using a mouse? What about different zoom-levels, font-size and screen widths?\r\n\r\nIn software, our applications are becoming increasingly data-driven, with lots of great JavaScript libraries that produce beautiful charts—currently (April 2022), however, almost all of them have critical accessibility issues. \r\n\r\nIn this session we'll design and build a dynamic bar chart component, commonly used in customer-facing applications, and test it with keyboard, screen reader and other accessibility testing tools. We'll also briefly cover alt-text for static images and data visualisations, JS chart library recommendations, and where to learn more.",

            description:
              "Depending on who you ask, 15-20% of the world's population has some form of disability. Despite this, the vast majority of software isn't fully accessible. Building truly accessible systems starts with asking questions. What does it mean to be disabled? How do we know whether people can use our website? And what if our users have access issues that we don't know about?\r\n\r\nMany of these core concepts are covered by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, which are the governing standard for web accessibility. However, some scenarios require us to dig a little deeper. We'll look at situations where you might need to think beyond the guidelines, and some of the resources and tools that you can use to help you do so.\r\n\r\nFinally, we'll learn how to meet a variety of different accessibility requirements by breaking down a series of real-world case studies. We'll take a magnifying glass to a large tech company's user interfaces, time travel back to the GeoCities era, apply some concepts from emergency press conferences to online content delivery, hack a life-saving medical device, and attempt to navigate technical events (and stairs). By the end of the talk, you should understand why it's important to evaluate the accessibility of your software, what goes wrong when assessments don't happen, and how to apply these lessons to design systems that work for everyone.",

But, to be clear, that doesn’t mean we have a CPU, RAM, and hard disk.  Come along to this talk to learn what it really means for a calculator, a phone, and for US to be computers.\r\n\r\nThis is not a talk about machine learning algorithms, it’s more about what it means to be a thinking machine.  It’s not only about helping computers think more like us, but also helping us to understand that we are more like computers.  It will help you prepare for the coming wave of “thinking machines.”\r\n\r\nAI/ML software has already beaten the world’s best humans at Chess, Jeopardy, Go, and some video games, and now it’s learning how to play games from scratch, writing text, writing code, and more.  As a result, it’s also time for us to start talking more about “machine with minds.”\r\n\r\nThis talk will also hypothesise a little about what it means for a computer (and us) to be aware, self-aware, to have free will, and to feel like we do, i.e. to have a mind. It combines research in Computer Science, Cognitive Science, Neuroscience, even and some Philosophy of Mind.\r\n\r\nThe speaker has a PhD in Artificial Intelligence (including Cognitive Science and Neuroscience) from UNSW.  They have written and published research and conference papers on AI.  They have provided advice and guidance to AI startups, and to organisations keen to use AI to improve their operations.',

            description:
              'A new toxic element has emerged within the workplace, the defence of “best practice”. This blanket term has become ubiquitous amongst many architectural design sessions and it is hurting innovation and user outcomes. The term “best practice” is often used without any context and used to justify someone’s design decisions without having to explain that justification. It is a term that is used to shutdown any discussion, and will likely be used to elevate one’s ideas without merit.\r\n\r\nI frequently push people to break down their assertion that their design decisions are “best practice”. This involves challenging people to firstly understand the goals with greater clarity:\r\nAre we prioritising costs, user enablement, time? \r\nWhat constraints are we working with? Do we have specific environments we have to work in?\r\nWhat problem are we ACTUALLY trying to solve?\r\n\r\nBy embracing these elements, we can actually frame our decisions in a way that enable a greater level of understanding by rephrasing “best practice” into something that is more structured. For example:\r\n\r\nAs we are trying to get our customers using {product feature} as quickly as possible, I think we should look at using {service A} with {service B} as it will allow us to get consumers on our platform using {product C} quickly. \r\n\r\nBy focusing more on the problem, the priorities/constraints, we can design solutions together that meet our needs, rather than just doing what someone else did and call it “best practice”\r\n',

You can use it to find gaps in your backlog, organise your backlog in a clearer way, onboard new developers, and highlight the features and stories of an MVP or upcoming release. They can even be used in a funding request or proposal to communicate your product vision.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I want to share with you how to create a simple product feature tree and why it should be used in every delivery project.",

Developers demonstrate creativity every day through problem-solving, application/system design, and code optimization. Even the most creative people can struggle to replicate the images in their heads on paper or canvas with pen or paint. \r\n\r\nSo, what can a developer do to express their inner Van Gogh, Picasso or Da Vinci? Enter creative coding; the creation of visual masterpieces with code! Imagine the graphics library as a canvas, language as paint, algorithms as the method. Let me rouse the artist within you, and inspire you to create intriguing, unique, original, and even beautiful pieces of digital art using code. \r\n\r\nJust like with traditional art, it can be hard to know how or where to start. Graphics programming often involves mathematics that can be daunting for anyone without a PhD in maths. \r\n\r\nIn this session, you will learn some ways to get started, some approaches to creating static and animated art with code, and that the maths really isn't that scary at all. You will be creating your own codified artworks in no time!",

Worse, it's possible to ruin users' experience by accidentally fixing bugs that their workflows had come to rely on. To combat this we need to ensure that our refactor doesn't change the existing behaviour in any way, while also leaving us free to add new functionality.\r\n\r\nWe're going to have a look at how to decide when we actually should refactor, and how we can use tests to ensure we maintain the existing behaviour. We'll have a look at our options for testing JSX, and the pros and cons of snapshot tests. And we'll finish up with a demo, putting it all together.",

                "Depending on who you ask, 15-20% of the world's population has some form of disability. Despite this, the vast majority of software isn't fully accessible. Building truly accessible systems starts with asking questions. What does it mean to be disabled? How do we know whether people can use our website? And what if our users have access issues that we don't know about?\r\n\r\nMany of these core concepts are covered by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, which are the governing standard for web accessibility. However, some scenarios require us to dig a little deeper. We'll look at situations where you might need to think beyond the guidelines, and some of the resources and tools that you can use to help you do so.\r\n\r\nFinally, we'll learn how to meet a variety of different accessibility requirements by breaking down a series of real-world case studies. We'll take a magnifying glass to a large tech company's user interfaces, time travel back to the GeoCities era, apply some concepts from emergency press conferences to online content delivery, hack a life-saving medical device, and attempt to navigate technical events (and stairs). By the end of the talk, you should understand why it's important to evaluate the accessibility of your software, what goes wrong when assessments don't happen, and how to apply these lessons to design systems that work for everyone.",

I will share the key insights that I have learned from over 10+ years of experience in Banking, Government and the Startup space, leading teams to build, deploy and run systems comprising dozens of microservices. We\'ll explore practical techniques that you can start using today to enable your releases to go smoothly, whilst also providing you with some key areas of focus in your longer-term DevOps strategy.\r\n\r\nFinally, I\'ll introduce several really simple, practical coding techniques that make deploying at speed, easy and relatively painless...

Most COVID-19 data was presented as images on social media without alternative text-descriptions, or as interactive charts that were often too complicated to understand, or didn't work with increased font size, keyboards, screen readers, and other assistive devices and settings. \r\n\r\nBecause of this, many people with disabilities or varying levels of education and data literacy were excluded from receiving important health information—discrimination with fatal consequences.\r\n\r\nWhen we think about data visualisation accessibility, we often think \"colour blindness\", but what about total blindness? What about using the chart without using a mouse? What about different zoom-levels, font-size and screen widths?\r\n\r\nIn software, our applications are becoming increasingly data-driven, with lots of great JavaScript libraries that produce beautiful charts—currently (April 2022), however, almost all of them have critical accessibility issues. \r\n\r\nIn this session we'll design and build a dynamic bar chart component, commonly used in customer-facing applications, and test it with keyboard, screen reader and other accessibility testing tools. We'll also briefly cover alt-text for static images and data visualisations, JS chart library recommendations, and where to learn more.",

The approaches that served us so well in the pre-cloud era don't seem to hold up in the new reality. \r\n\r\nIt feels like you're spending more time configuring local environments than writing code, tests are flaky and every day is filled with the same feeling of frustration.\r\n\r\nBased on my own experiences building serverless applications for startups in enterprises here in Australia and abroad, and taking testing back to first principles, we'll explore both the patterns and anti-patterns of serverless testing.\r\n\r\nI'll answer such questions as:\r\n- Why localstack sounds great in theory, but fails in reality\r\n- Whether the vaunted testing pyramid is still valid\r\n- How to configure your cloud environments to unblock teams and reach development nirvana",

But, to be clear, that doesn’t mean we have a CPU, RAM, and hard disk.  Come along to this talk to learn what it really means for a calculator, a phone, and for US to be computers.\r\n\r\nThis is not a talk about machine learning algorithms, it’s more about what it means to be a thinking machine.  It’s not only about helping computers think more like us, but also helping us to understand that we are more like computers.  It will help you prepare for the coming wave of “thinking machines.”\r\n\r\nAI/ML software has already beaten the world’s best humans at Chess, Jeopardy, Go, and some video games, and now it’s learning how to play games from scratch, writing text, writing code, and more.  As a result, it’s also time for us to start talking more about “machine with minds.”\r\n\r\nThis talk will also hypothesise a little about what it means for a computer (and us) to be aware, self-aware, to have free will, and to feel like we do, i.e. to have a mind. It combines research in Computer Science, Cognitive Science, Neuroscience, even and some Philosophy of Mind.\r\n\r\nThe speaker has a PhD in Artificial Intelligence (including Cognitive Science and Neuroscience) from UNSW.  They have written and published research and conference papers on AI.  They have provided advice and guidance to AI startups, and to organisations keen to use AI to improve their operations.',

Everywhere we looked, companies were scrambling to utilize this illustrious beast, telling us that it represented the future of not only computing, but profitability and innovation. Look at Facebook or Google, leveraging vast quantities of information to better push ads targeting our insecurities and desires, or the multi-billion dollar companies that spawned out of it like Palantir or Visallo.\r\n\r\n\r\nFast forward ten years, and we barely ever hear the term Big Data uttered, let alone used in our day to day life. Instead, we’re getting inundated with terms like ‘Data Lake’, ‘Data Pond’, and ‘Data Lake House’. \r\n\r\n\r\nIs this terminology built just to confuse us? Is the ominous man up there in the Cloud making up irrational terms just to peddle us new technologies we don’t need, or is he just thirsty?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis blast-from-the-present talk from a cloud-native data engineer will demystify and un-complicate the current state of ‘Big Data’, and help you impress your friends and coworkers with a knowledge of made-up sounding tech buzzwords.',

                "The War for Technology Talent has been upon us for some time now, but the game has changed.\r\n\r\nIn order to combat closed borders, restricted travel and an adverse attitude towards changing jobs amid a global pandemic, the Perth Technology Talent market has had to undergo an evolution these past few years.\r\n\r\nMany businesses are faced with the same challenge as every other technically inclined business in Perth. How do we attract and retain the best technical people in the market? \r\n\r\nAs a business we are still working on this, but there are a number of talent acquisition strategies and cultural shifts that we have adopted to give us the best possible chance of securing Perth's top talent.\r\n\r\nWith these strategies in place, we have gone from a team of 4 to a team of 28 technical consultants working with the latest in Cloud technology in the space of 9 months. \r\n\r\nHow have we become the fastest growing technical consultancy in Perth? Join this session as we share some of our strategies in the War for Tech Talent!",

              description:
                'A new toxic element has emerged within the workplace, the defence of “best practice”. This blanket term has become ubiquitous amongst many architectural design sessions and it is hurting innovation and user outcomes. The term “best practice” is often used without any context and used to justify someone’s design decisions without having to explain that justification. It is a term that is used to shutdown any discussion, and will likely be used to elevate one’s ideas without merit.\r\n\r\nI frequently push people to break down their assertion that their design decisions are “best practice”. This involves challenging people to firstly understand the goals with greater clarity:\r\nAre we prioritising costs, user enablement, time? \r\nWhat constraints are we working with? Do we have specific environments we have to work in?\r\nWhat problem are we ACTUALLY trying to solve?\r\n\r\nBy embracing these elements, we can actually frame our decisions in a way that enable a greater level of understanding by rephrasing “best practice” into something that is more structured. For example:\r\n\r\nAs we are trying to get our customers using {product feature} as quickly as possible, I think we should look at using {service A} with {service B} as it will allow us to get consumers on our platform using {product C} quickly. \r\n\r\nBy focusing more on the problem, the priorities/constraints, we can design solutions together that meet our needs, rather than just doing what someone else did and call it “best practice”\r\n',

And if you've ever taken part in the post-mortem retrospective of failed project, you know that sometimes it's not exactly clear where a project falls down. \r\n\r\nUsing a series of mistakes from my life, this talk will walk you through identifying three pitfalls that cause failure in software development, and how we can learn to avoid them.

With a vile poison and some quantum magic, we were forced to the conclusion that the cat was both alive and dead at the same time. Over 80 years later, it is either one impressive cat or it is surely dead. I will resurrect Schrodinger's cat and discuss the implications of and on the famous thought experiment from the perspective of the recently developed fields of quantum information and computation, but not before showing you how we can share such seemingly complex concepts even to children!",
